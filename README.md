Simple calculator project created by me.

CSS not finished.

Project totally 100% mine.

Uses abstract class in JS xD
I will improve probably this or that soon.

First thing i want to improve is CSS. What i have works, and thats it.

Features:
-negative numbers, positive numbers
-factorial
-power of 2
-square root
-floating point numbers
-overwrite flag (after using equals, delete or insert digit replaces whole number)
-can compute using operators instead of = sign
-if youre too busy to find out why its great and i spent 2 days doing it (while doing other stuff) - GET OUT, i cant explain it in this short presentation xD
