Simple calculator project created by me.

CSS not finished.

Project totally 100% mine.

Uses abstract class in JS xD
I will improve probably this or that soon.

First thing i want to improve is CSS. What i have works, and thats it.

Features:
- negative numbers, positive numbers
- factorial
- power of 2
- square root
- floating point numbers
- overwrite flag (after using equals, delete or insert digit replaces whole number)
- can compute using operators instead of = sign
EDIT FROM FUTURE: I added some things (ripple effects, new features) but i forgot to update. So heres update.
BTW i also included my old file when i wanted to write OutputController class (its commented out).
